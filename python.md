# Python Programming - Basics for Non-Programmers Course Outline

## Overview
This is an introductory Python programming course which provides a strong foundation that would allow students to further their skills with additional education. The course begins with an overview of Python and quickly has students building simple applications. Python syntax, including function and module design is considered. File consumption and exception handling are also included early in the class. In addition, there is an examination of using different data types.

## Audience Profile
This course is intended for new developers or developers who wish to transition to the Python platform. For those that are new, Python makes an excellent first programming language.

## Prerequisites
This course is specially designed for individuals with little or no programming background. If you have prior programming experience, you should consider our regular Introduction to Python course.
