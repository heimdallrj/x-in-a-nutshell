# Best Way to Learn Python (2020 Step-by-Step Guide)

Python is a very popular language.

Itâ€™s also one of the languages that I recommend for beginners to start with.

But how do you go about learning this language?

The best way to learn Python is to understand the big picture of all what you need to learn before you dive in and start learning.

In this article, I divide the path of learning Python into 6 levels.

Each level covers a subset of the language that you need to master before you move on to the next one.

My focus on this article is for you to be a competent well-rounded programmer so you can easily get a job at any tech company that you choose.

But donâ€™t worry, you donâ€™t need to go all the way to level 6 in order to get your first job ðŸ™‚

Letâ€™s get started.

## Level 0: The Beginnings

This is the level you begin at if you are an absolute beginner.

And by absolute beginner, I mean someone who has never coded before in Python or any other programming language for that matter.

If you are coming from a different programming language, then you should skip to level 1.

In this level, most of the concepts you will be learning are general programming concepts. The fundamental skills that will bootstrap you as a programmer.

This means that these concepts are not really exclusive to Python but can be extended to other programming languages as well.

You see, a lot of programming languages are very similar and knowing whatâ€™s common (and whatâ€™s not) between programming languages will help you transition into a different one in the future.

If you are at this level, then I highly recommend this course on Udemy.

So what are some of these general programming concepts that I am talking about?

Some of these fundamental concepts are variables, data types, operations, functions, conditionals, and loops.

If you understand what these concepts are, then skip to level 1.

Otherwise, Let me give you a very brief introduction about what these concepts mean.
